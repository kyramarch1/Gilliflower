## Gilliflower/Gilly Flower

The Gilliflower (Gilly Flower or Jilly Flower) is a type of carnation that was grown at Dumbarton Oaks and mentioned in the archival records of the William Hammond Dorsey family. In this image, it is mentioned that the Dorsey's garden had "jilly flowers," which were most likely planted and taken care of by enslaved people that the Dorsey family owned.
